# UCF-Computer-Graphics
Enrolled in CAP 4720: Computer Graphics at UCF during the Fall Semester.

The course work included learning Computer Graphic topics: linear algebra, transforming objects in a 3D space, material, lighting, texture mapping, and Ray Tracing. Programming assignments using OpenGl and Python:
- Assignment 2: Getting Ready for OpenGL Programming
- Assignment 3: OpenGL Programming: Simple rendering
- Assignment 4: Transformations
- Assignment 5: Camera
- Assignment 6: Multi-Viewport
- Assignment 7: Lighting & Material Computation (Diffuse + Specular + Ambient)
- Assignment 8: Toon Shading
- Assignment 9: Textures
- Assignment 10: Shadow Mapping
- Final Project

The Final Project was on Procedural Terrain Generation. Using OpenGL and Python I created a program that generated  terrain based on a function (Perlin, Ridged, or Billow) and number of squares.
